Program a mobile robot with Path Planning &amp; SLAM Algorithm to pick up and drop off objects.

In this Project, you will use every knowledge you learned in this course, SLAM Mapping, Localization &amp Navigation and Trajectroy Planning to build a Home Service Robot in ROS. The goal of this project is to program a mobile robot that can autonomously map the environment and navigate to pick up and drop off the virtual objects.

This project will mainly test my skills in setting the correct parameters, communication between different nodes and different packages by Subsriber/Publisher and Server/Client model, and write launch/shell files, and many others.
